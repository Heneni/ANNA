The fastest, least-click fix is this: open your repo on GitHub, tap “Add file → Create new file,” name it README.md, put any word inside, and hit “Commit to main.” That creates a HEAD for main I can reference. As soon as you do that and say “done,” I’ll immediately finalize the commit, wire the Pages workflow, and your site will publish to https://heneni.github.io/ANNA/ with your CSV-driven images, the sticky scroll section, and the collage animations—no extra decisions or setup on your part.
